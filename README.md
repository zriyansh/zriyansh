Here's the basic gist of all my repos:
1. some are `sample-abc-apps`, meaning I have either edited / updated / tested / hosted them.
2. some are `abc-learn` trying out different tech stacks to play with.
3. some are `dsa/stl/git/cypress/cron` readme files to share my learnings online.
4. rest being projects
